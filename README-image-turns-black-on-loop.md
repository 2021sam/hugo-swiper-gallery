Ah â€” thanks for the clarification. If **fixing the CSS** solved the black slide issue, here's what's likely going on:

---

## âœ… What Actually Happened: **Slides had height 0 due to CSS**

### Your old CSS likely had one of these issues:

* The `.swiper-slide` or `.swiper` containers didnâ€™t have a **fixed height** or weren't inheriting it properly.
* Because of that, the images were being loaded â€” but since their container had no height, they **werenâ€™t visible**, and appeared black.

---

### âœ… Why the Fix Worked

In your working CSS, you did **three important things** right:

#### 1. Set a fixed height on `.swiper`:

```css
.swiper {
  height: 400px;
}
```

#### 2. Matched `.swiper-slide` height to the container:

```css
.swiper-slide {
  height: 100%;
}
```

#### 3. Ensured the image fills the slide:

```css
.swiper-slide img {
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

Together, these guarantee that:

* Swiper has visible space to render each slide.
* Slides take up full vertical space.
* Images are properly scaled and shown.

## ðŸ§  Why It Broke Slide 6 Specifically

Likely, **images in slide 6 were different sizes** (e.g., portrait vs landscape), so:

* Without a fixed container height, layout inconsistencies caused Swiper to glitch during loop transitions.
* When looping, Swiper uses **cloned slides**, and height miscalculations during cloning can cause visual issues â€” such as blank/black slides â€” if no height is enforced.

## âœ… Summary

| Issue             | Explanation                                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Black slides      | Slide/image containers had no visible height               |
| CSS Fix           | Gave `.swiper` and `.swiper-slide` fixed, matching heights |
| Why slide 6 broke | Image aspect ratios likely exposed the layout flaw         |

Let me know if you want me to review the full CSS cascade or create a fallback system for inconsistent image sizes.

# Fix:
.swiper-slide img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;              /* ðŸ”„ Let it scale naturally */
  max-height: 100%;          /* âœ… Prevent overflow */
  object-fit: contain;       /* or 'cover' if you prefer cropping */
  display: block;
  border-radius: 8px;
  background-color: #fff;    /* âœ… Avoid transparent background */
}
